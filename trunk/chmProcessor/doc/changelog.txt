
* 1.7.2

- Fixed bug when the source file had no title tag: Search was not working properly

* 1.7.1
- Fixed bug generating a Word file directly from command line
- Added a new exe for command line generation
- Added new settings option to disable waiting for MS Word close: To avoid application hangs.

* 1.7

- Code was a pile of crap: 
	* Now almost the code is on English language (not all).
	* Code restructuring: C# convention code (upper capitalization for members, etc) , new classes for different generations, new classes for document parsing, etc (not finished).
- MSHTML is not longer used. Instead, the nice HTML agility pack is used.
- Now you can choose between two web help templates: The old one with frames, and a new one, using jQuery. This one should be prettier, it has navigation buttons, and it tracks on the URL hash the currently shown help topic. 
- Bugs fixed.



* 1.6.3
- Wrong Microsoft.mshtml.dll was distributed with 1.6.2. Now should be the right (the PIA dll)

* 1.6
- Non western character sets (Cyrillic, chinese, japanese, etc) for CHM files now should work: Cyrilic has been tested and it seems to works. I need feedback about this. Please, say me if it works.
- Added partial support to generate CHM files for languages different than the local system language.
- Path to files of the chmprocessor project now can be stored relative to the location of the project. Thanks to Jozsef Bekes for the patch.

- Added field to project to add HTML code into the head tag of the generated web pages (to add google analytics code, for example)
- Added setting to remove / repair broken internal links.
- Tidy.dll (v2003) is no more used. Instead, tidy.exe v2009 is used now. This solves issues fixing html encoded with utf-8. 


* 1.5
- Bug fixed. chmProcessor was not working on 64 bits operating systems due to AnyCPU option. Now the application runs always on 32 bit mode, needed to run Tidy. Thanks to cjervin for the info.
- Multiple Word documents can be joined on a single help.
- Added option /q for Quiet mode (Thanks to Mike Hudgell):
Quiet mode [/q] prevents a window being shown when run with the /g command line and logs messages to stdout/stderr.
- Added option to make the log more or less verbose (Thanks to Mike Hudgell): 
Log Level [/l1, /l2, /l3] lets you choose how much information is output, where /l1 is minimal and /l3 is all the information.

- Bug fixed "Hyperlink images are not included in CHM" (Thanks to Paolo Moretti)
- Bug fixed "If 2 styles "title 1 and 2" follows without text, the conversion is not good."

* 1.3
- Google sitemap generation for web help.

- HTML cleaning with Tidy.
- Full text search in web help.
- Added setup with redistributable needed files (no more "Microsoft.mshtml assembly not found" error ).
