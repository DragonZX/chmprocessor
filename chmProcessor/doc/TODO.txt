BUGS
------------------

- chmProcessor own documentation: With there is an initial "Help content" section??? WTF. 
- Whitespaces on CHM titles: Html test / Section "17.2.1. Using return-property to explicitly specify column/alias names" adds extra whitespaces. They should not be there.
- Frames webhelp template selects nodes on the tree when a full text search link is pressed but
  the jQuery template dont do it.
- AppLocale test has some kind of bug. There is characters show as "?" on the CHM...

IMPROVEMENTS
------------------

- Change documentation. Think about documentate the chmprocessorlib for external use.
- Remove temporal file with joined word docs.
- If pdfcreator hangs up, if the user press cancel, exit inmediatelly. Add a referente to the user interface to the PdfPrinter class and check if the process was cancelled.
- AppSettings should not have a bunch of static members. make two static functions, to save and load from the registry, and make non-static the other members.
- Change translation text files to the standard for .NET bundles.
- Add a new level log on ConsoleUserInterface with a value WARNING. Change the current level ERRORWARNING to ERROR. Review all log generation to choose between both.
- Add option at settings window to set the level log.
- Translate all the spanish code to english.
- Add option to not create the CHM.
- Use standard api to keep last opened files.
- Make a BAT to clear the application registry node
- UI: When "add directory" is pressed on "Additional files" tab, the initial directory should be the help project file directory.
- Remove all "about:blank" replacements
- Try to replace all the web indexing stuff by lucene.
- Remove references to PDF Creator
- Documentation: Warn about chrome and local filesystem.
- Licenses: Add jquery, layouts and tree
- jQuery template: If there is a single html page, hide previous, next and home buttons. If we are on
  the last or first page, disable links for previous / next home.
